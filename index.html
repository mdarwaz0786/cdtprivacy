  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 13, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Code Diffusion Technologies</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects the personal data of users ("you", "your") of the mobile application <strong>CDT Portal</strong> (the "App").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect and process the following information from users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Employee name and ID</li>
    <li>Location data (used only during check-in/check-out)</li>
    <li>Device information (OS version, model)</li>
    <li>Time and date of attendance actions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To track and manage employee attendance</li>
    <li>To verify user location during attendance marking</li>
    <li>To improve app functionality and user experience</li>
    <li>To communicate with your employer or HR system</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Location Permission Disclosure</h2>
  <p>The app uses <strong>foreground location access</strong> permission (<code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code>) solely to confirm your location at the time of marking attendance (check-in/check-out). This data is not collected continuously and is not used for background tracking.</p>
  <p>The location is accessed only when the user initiates the attendance action, and the app requests permission through a system dialog in compliance with Android guidelines.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties, except:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With your employer or HR personnel</li>
    <li>With service providers under contract who help with our business operations</li>
    <li>When required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to secure your data. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Request access to the data we hold about you</li>
    <li>Request corrections to your data</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your data, subject to legal obligations</li>
  </ul>
